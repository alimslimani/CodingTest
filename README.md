# CodingTest
To realize this test, I used a TDD and SOLID principle.

# Execute program
To execute this program;
 - Go to : yourPath\CodingTest\out\artifacts\BnpCoding_jar
 - Exec this command :  java -cp BnpCoding.jar com.bnp.coding.CodingTrainCompany "yourPathFileReader\CandidateInputExample.txt" "yourPathFileWriter\CandidateOutput.txt"

# TDD
For testing, I did different test cases according to the specification provided in the TestDetail file.
You can see all test cases in src\test\com\bnp\coding\CodingTrainCompanyTest.java

# SOLID
After doing some test cases, for development, I used SOLID principles
